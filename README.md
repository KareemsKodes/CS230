Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The Gaming room is a game company that wanted us to make a game for them called Draw it or Lose it. In this game, there would be teams made up of players. There would be multiple rounds. In each round, a picture would render over 30 seconds and the team whose turn it was would have to guess what the image was. If they did not guess in time, the opposing team would have some time to guess themselves, I believe it was 10 or 15 seconds. They wanted to be able to support many instances of the game so there could be many people playing on teams in different games at the same time. They also wanted the game to be available on as many platofrms as possible. 

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
I think I did a good job at analysing the requirments, looking at the different platforms, seeing the positives and benefits of the different platforms, and I think I did well at articulating a recomendation for the the design of the software.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
I think that the way that the software design document breaks down each individual aspect of the development and explains it from the bottom up. I think that having the different charts and diagrqams there were very useful when coming up with a design, and having a breakdown of the different platforms and systems helped me to make a good recommendation because I was able to reference what I needed to.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I feel like I would revise a little bit of my recommendation. I think explain my choices a little more in detail just to make my recommendation a little clearer. Other than that, I think I did a pretty good job overall.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I took the needs of the user and based my entire design on the specifications that they provided. They wanted support for multiple game instances, so I made sure that I considered that in every aspect of the game design. Making sure to consider the user's needs is important because they are the ones who the design is for. The entire design should revolve around their needs.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
I Broke down the requirements into different parts. I then created a general outline for how to approach the design. Then I made a UML diagram and I analyzed the different operating platforms. After that I made a recomendation based on the information I had and how the requirements I was given would fit with the operating platforms. I would use a similar approach to this in the future because I found it to be very effective.
